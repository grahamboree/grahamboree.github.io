Hi! I'm Graham. I'm an indie game developer from Boston with over a decade of game development experience. I'm currently at [Spry Fox](https://spryfox.com) working on a cozy non-violent MMO.  I help organize the 2500 member [Boston Unity Group](https://www.meetup.com/B-U-G-Boston-Unity-Group/) meetup, maintain the industry-standard [Recast](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation) navmesh and navigation library that ships in Unity, Unreal and Godot, and am part of the [Boston Indie Game Collective](http://www.indiegamecollective.org).

In my career I've worked on everything from AAA action RPGs to MMOs to mobile puzzle games to cutting-edge conversational AI systems.  Most recently, I led an engineering team of 8 on [Cozy Grove](https://cozygrovegame.com), a relaxing, story-driven game which shipped on iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, Mac, PC, Switch, Xbox One, and PS4 across 6 storefronts in 2020.
